# Capstone-Project

## Project Proposal

Startup Organizations

Startup organizations have been appearing all over the nation. They have already made huge advances in industries across the board and continue to do so. These companies are very exciting and can potentially return a large payout to employees from stock options if the venture becomes successful. They are attracting top talent ranging from former executives to recent grads. I would like to analyze the top attributes/skills/locations/education/etc. of these hires. This analysis will benefit those looking to join a startup organization, whether as a current student, recent graduate or a current professional contemplating a company shift. It will allow potential candidates to become more employable to work for a startup. The analysis may impact decisions regarding college major choice, pursuit of certifications, location, work experience, and self-taught knowledge.

The dataset would need to include employee data from companies that meet criteria to be labeled a startup. As there is not a clear-cut definition of what constitutes a startup, some assumptions will need to be made. For this project, LinkedIn's 2018 Top Startups list will be used to define the criteria that constitutes a startup. Companies must be independent and privately held, have 50 or more employees, be 7 years old or younger, and be headquartered in the country on whose list they appear. The dataset will be built from scraping techniques on Glassdoor. It will include job title, location, and summary of the jobs listed on Glassdoor for the companies on the Top 50 Startups list from LinkedIn.

The dataset will give insights into the most common programming language knowledge requested, education, location, and work experience for these jobs. The final project will be in the format of an R Markdown document, which will consist of the dataset, code written in R programming language, a report on the findings/insights gained, and visualizations of different graphs/charts to illustrate the insights.
